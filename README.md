# Subhashree Sahu 

*"I don't have to tell about Sahu. If you don't know her, first go and search on search engines.**

*Now, we all know that Sahu made a mistake in her past. Everyone does, and if it was a big mistake, admit it—she is only seventeen years old nd she never thought that it can destroy her mental piece. I think a lot of girls have done the same as she did in that situation. These things are happening because of some stupid people. After a long time, she made a comeback on Diwali. This time her manager was "Zee" and NMZ media. She was famous, so her followers were increasing quickly.**

*Now, a girl named "Chand, Chndd, whatever it is, IDGAF... She jealously asked her friend (Aishwary) to hack Subhashree's account. Now, if you know, Instagram asks for a trusted device if anyone wants to change personal information in the account. So, her manager "Zee" betrayed Sahu and gave her account's access to Aishwary."**

Aishwary, by collaborating with others to hack accounts and exploit personal moments, shows a lack of respect for privacy and decency.
